# Self-Driving Car Simulation with JavaScript

This project is a self-driving car simulation implemented in JavaScript without relying on external libraries. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of programming fundamentals, artificial intelligence concepts, and problem-solving skills. 

## Overview
In this project, we aim to create a self-driving car simulation from scratch, covering various components such as driving mechanics, environment definition, sensor simulation, collision detection, and neural network-based car control. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience in building complex systems and implementing artificial intelligence techniques.

## Key Features
- **Custom Implementation**: No external libraries are used, demonstrating proficiency in JavaScript and core programming concepts.
- **Driving Mechanics**: Implementing the fundamental mechanics of car movement and control.
- **Environment Definition**: Defining the environment in which the car operates, including roads, obstacles, and other elements.
- **Sensor Simulation**: Simulating sensors for the car to perceive its surroundings.
- **Collision Detection**: Implementing algorithms to detect collisions between the car and other objects.
- **Neural Network Control**: Using neural networks to enable the car to control itself based on sensor inputs.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the neural network's functionality to aid understanding.

## Getting Started
To run the simulation locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the simulation.
4. Use save button:`üèÜüì•`, to manually save the `best-car-brain` in `localStorage` , Use delete button: `üî™ü™¶`, if you want to clear it from `localStorage`.
5. Saving a `best-car-brain` and reloading the page will restart the simulation using this car-brain as a parent.
6. This process subsequently trains the model to become self sufficient in driving between the traffic.
7. After the model is successfully trained, you will find a variable `N` in `main.js` change it's value to =1; and reload to see the trained model.
